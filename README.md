# Simple E-Commerce Application

This is a simple e-commerce application built using React.js. It consists of four main screens: a product entry form, a product display screen with search and sorting options, a product details screen, and a shopping cart screen. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate proficiency in building functional and user-friendly interfaces using React components.

## Features
